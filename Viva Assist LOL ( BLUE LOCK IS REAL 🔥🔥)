### Viva Q&A for Information Security

**Q1. What is Information Security?**
- **Answer**: Information security is the practice of protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.

**Q2. What are the three main objectives of Information Security?**
- **Answer**: The three main objectives, often referred to as the CIA triad, are:
  - **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.
  - **Integrity**: Protecting information from being altered or tampered with by unauthorized parties.
  - **Availability**: Ensuring that information and resources are available to authorized users when needed.

**Q3. What is a Firewall?**
- **Answer**: A firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks.

**Q4. What is Encryption?**
- **Answer**: Encryption is the process of converting plain text into a coded format (cipher text) using an algorithm and an encryption key. This ensures that only authorized parties with the decryption key can read the original information.

**Q5. What is a Digital Signature?**
- **Answer**: A digital signature is an electronic signature that uses cryptographic techniques to provide proof of the authenticity and integrity of digital messages or documents. It ensures that the message was sent by a known sender and has not been altered.

**Q6. What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?**
- **Answer**: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a security process in which users provide two different authentication factors to verify their identity. It adds an extra layer of security by combining something the user knows (password) with something the user has (e.g., a mobile device or security token).

**Q7. What is Phishing?**
- **Answer**: Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers attempt to deceive individuals into providing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details, by pretending to be a trustworthy entity in electronic communications.

**Q8. What is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?**
- **Answer**: An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors network or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations and alerts administrators when such activities are detected.

**Q9. What are the differences between Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption?**
- **Answer**: 
  - **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. It is fast and suitable for encrypting large amounts of data. Example: AES.
  - **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a pair of keys (public and private). The public key encrypts data, and the private key decrypts it. It is more secure but slower. Example: RSA.

**Q10. What is a VPN?**
- **Answer**: A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technology that creates a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet. It allows users to securely access and transmit data as if they were connected to a private network.
