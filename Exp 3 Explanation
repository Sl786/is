### Understanding the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) Code

**Concept**:
The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is a cryptographic algorithm used to generate and verify digital signatures. It ensures the authenticity and integrity of digital messages or documents. The key components of DSA include key generation, signature generation, and signature verification.

**Code Explanation**:

1. **Finding Primes (p and q)**:
   - `get_next_prime`: Finds the next probable prime number greater than a given number.
   - `find_q`: Finds a prime factor `q` of `p-1`, where `p` is the prime number found.

2. **Generator (g)**:
   - `get_gen`: Computes the generator `g` using primes `p` and `q`.

3. **Modular Inverse**:
   - `mod_inverse`: Computes the modular inverse of a given number using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

4. **Key Generation**:
   - **Private Key (x)**: A random number between 1 and `q-1`.
   - **Public Key (y)**: Computed as `y = g^x mod p`.

5. **Signature Generation**:
   - **Random Secret (k)**: A random number between 1 and `q-1`.
   - **Signature Components (r and s)**:
     - `r = (g^k mod p) mod q`.
     - `s = k_inv * (hash_val + x * r) mod q`, where `k_inv` is the modular inverse of `k`.

6. **Verification Process**:
   - **Verify Signature**:
     - Compute `w = mod_inverse(s, q)`.
     - Compute `u1 = (hash_val * w) mod q` and `u2 = (r * w) mod q`.
     - Compute `v = ((g^u1 mod p) * (y^u2 mod p) mod p) mod q`.
     - Check if `v` equals `r` to verify the signature.
